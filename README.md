# Traace Front Exercise

## Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## API url

```bash
http://localhost:5173/api (/api)
```

## Specs

The goal of the app that you’re building is to list movies ranked by duration using **React**.

At this moment, the app is basically a blank page with a title. Feel free to delete the title if you want.

You’re in charge of the front end and the server team is working on the back-end. They gave you an "REST" API url (/api) to retrieve the data all in one call.

What we expect you to build, is an interface for displaying the movies ranked by duration. We use Ant Design as a UI framework and we would like you to use the `Table` component.

The table should have the following columns:

- Poster
- Title
- Year of release
- Duration (with the format hh:mm:ss)
- Plot

Feel free to group multiple information in one column if you think it’s relevant!

The table might be paginated if you think it’s relevant too.

## Side notes

- It’s important that you produce clear, reusable, future-proof code.
- Produce a good-looking interface, but don’t focus on fancy CSS the quality of the JS is more important.
- Don’t hesitate to comment your code if you feel it will make it clearer

## Deliverable

You’re expected to deliver a Github Repo with clear install and run instructions as well as a screenshot in the readme file.
