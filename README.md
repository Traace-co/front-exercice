# Traace Front Exercise

## Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## API url
```bash
http://localhost:5173/api (/api)
```

## Specs

The goal of the app that you’re building is to list movies ranked by rating and be able to filter them by genres using **React**.

At this moment, the app is basically a blank page with a title. Feel free to delete the title if you want.

You’re in charge of the front end and the server team is working on the back-end. They gave you a "REST" API url (/api) to retrieve the data all in one call.

What we expect you to build, is an interface for displaying the **10 best movies ranked by scores**

The table should have the following columns:
- Poster
- Ranking
- Title
- Year of release
- Duration (with the format hh:mm:ss)
- Plot
- Genre *Clickable tags to filter the list*

Feel free to group multiple information in one column if you think it’s relevant!
The table should be paginated if you think it’s relevant too.

## Side notes

- You **must** use **react** and **functional components**. The interface **must** be in english. For the rest, we use Typescript and Antd as a component library, but feel free to use any library you’re comfortable with. Just make sure the code is easy to understand for us :)
- It’s important that you produce clear, reusable, future-proof code.
- Produce a good-looking interface, but don’t focus on fancy CSS the quality of the JS is more important.
- Don’t hesitate to comment your code if you feel it will make it clearer
- Take the time you need, but more importantly take the time you have available to do this exercise. Set yourself a time limit and try to stick to it. It's fine if you don't manage to do everything. Just tell us in your email how long it took you and we will take this into account in our rating.

## Deliverable

You’re expected to deliver a Github Repo with clear install and run instructions as well as a screenshot in the readme file.
